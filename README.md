Profit and loss analysis using JavaScript

In this project, i practiced writing JavaScript code to anaylse a financial dataset structured with arrays. Specifically, I practiced:
- writing 'loops' in order to make calculations such as the difference in profit/loss each month.
- intitialising variables to keep track of the data being calculated in loops.
- using concatenation to produce sentences with the data output in the console log.

<h2>Output</h2>
